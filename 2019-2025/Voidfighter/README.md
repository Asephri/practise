# Voidfighter
A 2D Shooter game built in c with sdl.

I followed a tutorial as this was my first time using c and the sdl library, a step up from modding stellaris or minecraft.

The tutorial covered basics in c and memory silly stuff as well as how to create objects and allocate memory etc. I'd say about 78% is my own work not followed from a tutorial.

The code SHOULD work on linux and macOS but i havent ported it yet and i dont know if thatll ever come.

I added a few unique enemy movements. scrolling effects, trails, points systems, a highscore table. its okay.

The graphics are awful and i wont be fixing them.
