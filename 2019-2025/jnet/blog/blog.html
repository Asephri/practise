							I'm not a huge fan of the background but it was the simplest I could make and I do intend to swap it out eventually for something more fun to me personally.
							<br></br>
							Along with restyling the site I have also restructured each page using tables to allow more control on how content is displayed. I'm sure there is better methods to this but it works for now and doesn't look bad. I would like a better image tiling method however and to adjust the padding between columns and rows.
							<br></br>
							I'm going to figure out the best way to host the website now it's in a state I am happy with. It would be fun to create a way to create posts from inside the website but thats another project for another time.
							<br></br>
							I'll still update the blog with updates of other projects I am working on and eventually someone other than me will be able to read them; and i'm thinking of adding a page for my personal hobbies.
							<br></br>
							Overall this has been a fun experience for me and I really want to modify the site over time to become better.
							<br></br>
							I will be adding another navigation bar for the blog. You'll see it if you view this in the future. I'll move the current site blog to one called <cite>"Site Development"</cite><br></br>

								In the above image you can see I have completed a rework of some of the style sheet switching out the old image system for a new one along with implementing a grid style system to structure pages rather than rely soley on flex boxes to do everything.
								<br></br>
								The way it works now is the flex boxes have grids inside of them alowing me to have more granular control over whats happening inside the boxes and allow for better spacing.
								<br></br>
								Along with the style sheet rework and redoing alot of the website alot of elements are now curved. I wanted to create an older style website from the mid 2000's i saw as a child but i basically decided that allowing it to be more modern is probably best for readability. This does not mean im sticking to conventional web design rules though. I am having fun and not subjecting myself to hard rules.
								<br></br>
								Most of the code is commented anyway so i dont forget lol, and if i ever need anyone to help me redo parts or go over my code with me its very readable and easy to figure out what's doing what.

								Shown above this work has led to the introduction of the galley page. Where you will find none other than my adorable cat Miso. He is a lovely loyal cat who is quite playful. He's suspected to be a british short haired tux mix of some sort.

								<p>Voidfighter now has its own home here for ease of access!</p>
								<p>
								I thought it would be best to house everything i make on the website here so it can all be found in the same space rather than split across the web. that'd be too much websurfing to find everyout about me so why not have 0 privacy here instead?
								<br></br>
								The video game section of the website will house more games in the future and I am going to work on porting them eventually. These are more of learning experiences for me rather than full playable fun games. Although i did get lost in playing it for abit the first time i finished it.
								<br></br>
								I also changed the sites image padding to be a gradient, the entire site still feels a bit creatively wrong. I think i'll redo the colour theme again eventually as well as prehaps a more modern grid/flex system. Currently to implement anything its a bit silly.

								<p>I have begun to code my website :)</p>
								<p>
								I've always had a fasination with programming especially websites. I dont know why i wanted one so bad, but now i have it. I originally wanted to be a web-developer when i was younger but life came about and i became a loser instead. This will be fun to post on though and play with :D
