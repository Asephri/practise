As a student studying LB170 a business communication skill I have developed throughout the module is in my own opinion Analysing. Specifically, being able to: Using reading strategies to read articles and business documents.
Prior to the module I hadnâ€™t ever been able to make sense business texts easily without struggle. This was an area I felt I had struggle in as I found I was overwhelmed by the amount and size of the readings as well as not being flexible in the choices I made when reading these documents missing key points and taking the information in at face value.
I felt very frustrated as I had failed to complete any of the tasks I had planned and went home feeling deflated as this would mean I would need to catch up by taking work home with me.
Resources that helped me improve this area were found throughout Block 1 and mostly early on between Weeks 1 to 4. I felt throughout the module that whilst my ability to extract information improved, I still struggled to convey it in meaningful ways within the bounds of what each TMA wanted despite trying which is reflected in the scores for each I received.
Useful frameworks I learnt were SWOT and STEEPLE. Which tied in nicely to analysing texts and write them down in a way that could be conveyed and were useful to learn because of it.
In conclusion I believe that spending more time on the module material then I did could of ultimately improved this business communication skill more as well as within the workplace and future further study.
I believe using the handbook specifically on STEEPLE and SWOT will prove useful in the future so the methods I learnt in LB170 for analysing will be useful in a workplace context.
